# Freelancing Progress Docket

This document tracks progress as I resume freelancing.

## Nmap Protocol

Progress files for this section are stored in [AUG_Week1_ToolCrash/Nmap](AUG_Week1_ToolCrash/Nmap/).

- [ ] Review basic usage and common flags.
- [ ] Practice scanning local networks.
- [ ] Save scans to `scans/` and record observations in `notes.md`.
- [ ] Maintain a daily log in `daily_log.md`.
- [ ] Capture completion screenshots for each exercise in `room_completion_screenshots/`.

<!-- Additional categories will be added over time. -->
